# Version-1-Malware
An experimental, in-development, malicious software with RCE, and Data Exfiltration capabilities as a core.

It relies on the an ideal process of infection:
1. Send specially crafted SE emails, with link to malicious site, using a dictionary of addresses.
2. If recipients visit the linked page, the payload is smuggled within imbedded JScript and saved onto the recipients machine.
3. If recipients execute the payload, the payload starts up 3 modules that will help in controlling the recipient machine and further spreading the payload.

## Modules
1. MediaWriter - Writes the payload to volumes other than the current working volume, this includes volumes of external storage media (ex. USB Drives)
2. Exfiltrator - Traverses the recipient home directory (and subdirectories) to find and exfiltrate files of specific extensions. (the size of data sent is capped)
3. CmdInterpreter - Remote Command Execution, for shell and payload specific commands.


## Languages used
- C# (For the API)
- Java (For the mail sender and the payload)
- Python (For Command and Control client)
